# CFE R Training demos

### September 2021

## Purpose

This project demonstrates how to use R to treat data for an OECD report and to create both OECD figures and country notes that could go along with the report.

The [Regions and Cities at a glance 2020](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/959d5ba0-en/1/3/2/4/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/959d5ba0-en&_csp_=77ce7d3756e86cc9068a0565516fcdaa&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book#component-d1e3802) report is used as an inspiration. Specifically, data is treated to recreate figure 2.11 of the report. Next, we pretend that we are asked to make country notes that would go along with the report. We first practice making the same figure, building on the data and figure created previously, for multiple countries. We then create multiple country notes that would go along with the report.

## Data

The original data is from [OECD Statistics](https://stats.oecd.org/BrandedView.aspx?oecd_bv_id=region-data-en&doi=f7445d96-en).
